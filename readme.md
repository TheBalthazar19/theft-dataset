# A Dataset for Automatic Violence Detection in Videos

This repository contains 350 video clips labelled as “non-violent” and “violent”, to be used to train and test algorithms for violence detection in videos. The non-violent clips are specifically recorded to include behaviours (hugs, claps, exulting, etc.) that can cause false positives in the violence detection task, due to fast movements and the similarity with violent behaviours.

## Data Description

The dataset is split into two main directories, “non-violent” and “violent”, labelling the included clips as showing non-violent behaviours and violent behaviours respectively.
